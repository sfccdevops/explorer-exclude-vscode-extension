Before you can submit a PR, you will need to:

2. Commit & Push your New Branch, with a comment like `Fixes #3` to auto trigger a status change for that issue
3. Make your Pull Request
4. Set `Reviewers` and `Assignees` to `Peter Schmalfeldt` ( or other project administrator )
5. Choose an appropriate label from the `Labels`
